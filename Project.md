**Subtitle:** "Proper sampling is crucial for accurate results. Follow our step-by-step guide to ensure reliable testing."

### General Sampling Principles
**Important Notes:**
- Use only clean, sterile containers (available from our lab)
- Avoid contamination during collection
- Label samples clearly with date, time, and source
- Transport samples promptly to maintain integrity

### Sample Collection by Water Type

#### **Tap Water Sampling**
**Step-by-step process:**
1. **Choose the right tap** - Kitchen tap preferred, avoid bathroom taps
2. **Clean the tap** - Wipe external surfaces with alcohol wipe
3. **Flush the system** - Run cold water for 2-3 minutes
4. **Fill the container** - Remove cap just before filling, don't touch inside of cap
5. **Avoid overflow** - Leave small air space at top
6. **Label immediately** - Date, time, location

#### **Borehole/Well Water Sampling**
**Special considerations:**
1. **Pump for 10-15 minutes** - Clear stagnant water from system
2. **Use the closest tap** - Avoid storage tanks if possible  
3. **Check pump operation** - Ensure normal flow and pressure
4. **Sample from dedicated sampling tap** - If available

#### **Surface Water Sampling**
**Safety and technique:**
1. **Safety first** - Wear protective gloves
2. **Wade into water** - Sample from flowing section, not stagnant areas
3. **Face upstream** - Avoid disturbing sediment
4. **Submerge container** - Open underwater to avoid surface contamination
5. **Multiple points** - Consider sampling from different locations

#### **Pool/Spa Water Sampling**
**Process:**
1. **Sample from middle of pool** - Away from inlet/outlet points
2. **Avoid surface scum** - Submerge container slightly
3. **Sample before chemical treatment** - If possible
4. **Note recent treatments** - Chemical additions in past 24 hours
